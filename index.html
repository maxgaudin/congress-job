      <h1>Congressional Campaign Personal Assistant</h1>
      <h3>About the Role:</h3>
      <p>A Louisiana public servant is preparing a run for Congress and is seeking a sharp, reliable, and hungry-for-experience individual to join the campaign team early. This is a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor, learn the ropes, and be a key part of a fast-moving political operation.</p>
      <p>You'll act as the candidate's right hand—helping with everything from logistics and scheduling to research, communications, and event prep. If you're looking for a crash course in Louisiana politics and have the stamina to learn by doing, this is for you.</p>
      
      <h3>What You'll Do:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Support the candidate with day-to-day logistics, errands, and scheduling</li>
         <li>Attend meetings, events, and campaign-related activities</li>
         <li>Conduct research on issues, districts, and potential donors or endorsers</li>
         <li>Coordinate with consultants, volunteers, and community leaders</li>
         <li>Keep the trains running on time—even when the tracks are still being laid</li>
         <li>Learn (quickly) how running for Congress actually works behind the scenes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>What We're Looking For:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>You live in the Greater New Orleans area</li>
         <li>A strong work ethic and a "no task too small" attitude</li>
         <li>Deep interest in Louisiana politics and public service</li>
         <li>Eager to build a career in politics or government</li>
         <li>Extremely dependable, discreet, and proactive</li>
         <li>Valid driver's license and flexible availability a plus</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Compensation:</h3>
      <p>This role starts as a part-time volunteer position with the potential to transition into a full-time paid role once the congressional campaign officially launches.</p>
      
      <h3>Apply If You're Ready To:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Drink from the proverbial firehose of political knowledge</li>
         <li>Build real skills and relationships in Louisiana politics</li>
         <li>Work directly with a candidate and seasoned strategists</li>
         <li>Put in the time now to make a serious impact in the race for Congress</li>
      </ul>
